WebHunter makes directory busting and sub-domain hunting easy. Its very easy to use. 

First run the setup.sh file using this command: ./setup.sh
I have include two wordlists. One for subdomain and one for directories. You can use any worlist you like. 
  i) Directory wordlist: files-and-dirs-wordlist.txt
  ii) Subdomain wordlist: subdomains-wordlist.txt
  
Now once you have done the above steps, run the tool using the command: python webhunter.py

Now use it, its very easy to use :)
