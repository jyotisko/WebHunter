# Usage
WebHunter makes directory busting and sub-domain hunting easy. Its very easy to use. 

First run the setup.sh file using this command: `./setup.sh`

I have include two wordlists. One for subdomain and one for directories. You can use any worlist you like. 
    i) Directory wordlist: files-and-dirs-wordlist.txt
    ii) Subdomain wordlist: subdomains-wordlist.txt
  
Now once you have done the above steps, run the tool using the command: `python webhunter.py`

Now use it, its very easy to use :)
This is a wordlist attack. The speed of completion will depend upon the ***length of the wordlist*** and ***your internet speed.***
